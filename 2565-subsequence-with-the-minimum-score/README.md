<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/subsequence-with-the-minimum-score/">2565. Subsequence With the Minimum Score</a></h2><h3>Hard</h3><hr><div><p>You are given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>You are allowed to remove any number of characters from the string <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>The score of the string is <code>0</code> if no characters are removed from the string <code>t</code>, otherwise:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Let <code>left</code> be the minimum index among all removed characters.</li>
	<li>Let <code>right</code> be the maximum index among all removed characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the score of the string is <code>right - left + 1</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the minimum possible score to make </em><code>t</code><em>&nbsp;a subsequence of </em><code>s</code><em>.</em></p>

<p>A <strong>subsequence</strong> of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., <code>"ace"</code> is a subsequence of <code>"<u>a</u>b<u>c</u>d<u>e</u>"</code> while <code>"aec"</code> is not).</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "abacaba", t = "bzaa"
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this example, we remove the character "z" at index 1 (0-indexed).
The string t becomes "baa" which is a subsequence of the string "abacaba" and the score is 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
It can be proven that 1 is the minimum score that we can achieve.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "cde", t = "xyz"
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this example, we remove characters "x", "y" and "z" at indices 0, 1, and 2 (0-indexed).
The string t becomes "" which is a subsequence of the string "cde" and the score is 2 - 0 + 1 = 3.
It can be proven that 3 is the minimum score that we can achieve.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length, t.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> and <code>t</code> consist of only lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>
