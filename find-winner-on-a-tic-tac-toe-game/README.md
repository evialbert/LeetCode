<h2>1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game</h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div><p>Tic-tac-toe is played&nbsp;by&nbsp;two players <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> on a&nbsp;<i>3</i>&nbsp;x&nbsp;<i>3</i>&nbsp;grid.</p>

<p>Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").</li>
	<li>The first player <em>A</em> always places "X" characters, while the second player <em>B</em>&nbsp;always places "O" characters.</li>
	<li>"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.</li>
	<li>The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.</li>
	<li>The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.</li>
	<li>No more moves can be played if the game is over.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given an array <code>moves</code> where each element&nbsp;is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> play.</p>

<p>Return the winner of the game if it exists (<em>A</em> or <em>B</em>), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".</p>

<p>You can assume that&nbsp;<code>moves</code> is&nbsp;<strong>valid</strong> (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe),&nbsp;the grid is initially empty and <em>A</em> will play <strong>first</strong>.</p>
