<p><b>Example 1:</b>
</p><pre><b>Input:</b>
"tree"

<b>Output:</b>
"eert"

<b>Explanation:</b>
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
</pre>

<p><b>Example 2:</b>
</p><pre><b>Input:</b>
"cccaaa"

<b>Output:</b>
"cccaaa"

Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
